# Consciousness Illumes
Consciousness Illumes is a project which aims to unify explorations and observations of consciousness. The project is currently founded as a website, as it is intended to be accessible to a broad audience.  

Consciousness Illumes is built on the values of... 

# Intentions
- Definition: what specifically does "consciousness" refer to and entail? It is necessary to provide a base point of reference (or multiple, potential base points of reference) to come back to when discussing topics about consciousness
- Research: avenues to explore consciousness
- Story: for what purpose is the study of consciousness for? What can come out of studying consciousness? For who or what is the study of consciousness in service of? 
- Express: how can consciousness be shared?

    - The Neuroscience page - the title may be changed - serves as the home for an interactive brain diagram. 
    - GOAL1: Using SVG, create a diagram of the outline of the brain from a lateral perspective. GOAL1 serves as the foundation for all lateral-view diagrams. 

    - GOAL2: Using SVG, create the first, outermost layer of the brain diagram. This includes defining distinct shapes which represent the brain structures: cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. 

    - GOAL3: Overlay GOAL2 over GOAL1 and animate GOAL2. GOAL1 should remain as a static, foundational shape behind GOAL2. Animate GOAL2:
        - assign a unique colour to each shape and include a uniformly-coloured border for the shapes
        - implement hover effects; when the cursor hovers over the structure, the shape should either change colour, become enlarged, or both. The cursor should enable the ability to click on the shape. 

    - GOAL4: Create a sidebar which enables selection of which brain view to display. 
        - None (foundational outline, or perhaps an image of the brain)
        - Outermost lateral (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem)
        - Lobes lateral (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital; brainstem and cerebellum)
        - Classic lateral (medulla oblongata, pons, brainstem, cerebellum, superior colliculi, inferior colliculi, tectum/tegmentum, visual cortex, motor cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, pineal gland, pituitary gland, corpus callosum)
        - Maybe: a deeper view into the middle structures (as to not overwhelm the lateral view. Perhaps when hovering over the centre of the brain, it is its own shape to direct to a zooming in of the area where the abundant structures are defined there)
        - Anterior view slice (olfactory bulb, optic chiasm, optic nerve)
